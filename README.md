# Phishing-URL-Detector
 In this project, we present a machine learning-based approach to identify whether a website is fraudulent or safe. The proposed solution utilizes the PhiUSIIL dataset, which comprises 134,850 legitimate URLs and 100,945 phishing URLs.

Phishing is a critical cybersecurity threat that attempts to deceive users into revealing sensitive information through fraudulent URLs. These types of attacks result in losses in the form of big finance and data breaches, while their frequency and sophistication are growing rapidly. 
This leaves the users open to these threats because of the lack of scalable, accurate, and adaptive solutions. This project aims to address this gap by using machine learning to classify URLs into phishing or legitimate classes using the Phishing URL Dataset. 

Our evaluation of multiple machine learning models has demonstrated outstanding results, with Random Forest emerging as the most robust and reliable model. Achieving perfect scores in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, Random Forest provides flawless predictions on the given dataset. Its reasonable training and testing times further enhance its practicality compared to more computationally intensive models like Neural Networks or SVM.

These high-performance results indicate that the model is not only highly accurate but also scalable and deployable for real-world applications. Incorporating the Random Forest classifier into email and web servers could significantly enhance the detection and prevention of phishing attacks. By embedding this system as an additional security layer, organizations can proactively identify malicious URLs, protect sensitive user data, and mitigate cyber threats with minimal latency.

Overall, the integration of this system into existing email and web infrastructure has the potential to bolster cybersecurity measures and deliver a seamless user experience while safeguarding digital interactions.
